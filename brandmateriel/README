To control the lander, use the mouse.:
    * Mouse movement changes pitch and yaw.
    * Right mouse button engages thruster.
    * Left does violence at the present.
    * The Middle mouse buttos will do violence in a possible future.
    * Don't run into the ground with too high velocity!

The objective is to save the houses from a raging forest fire, started
and spread by possibly extra-terrestrial pyromaniacs, neither of which
is currently not implemented. Make sure not to blow up any houses,
since this will lead to deduction of points...

The lander can also be turned using arrow keys and 'hjkl', but that's
not recommended.
