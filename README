This is the repository for Brandmateriel, a 3D game and engine inspired by
Zarch and written by Andreas Skyman in 2014.

The game is found in the "brandmateriel" sub-directory. It is started by
running "brand.py".

The subdirectory "demo" contains a few examples, the code of which is in some
cases out of date, but should be illustrative.
